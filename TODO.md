# To Do

- ~~Screens navigation~~
- ~~Learn how to render other components with props~~
- Implement simple quiz logic
- Look up for free APIs (Hiragana, Japanese words with pictures, audios)
- Add and configure `eslint`
- Find a way to use sort of Webpack resolve aliases (`Components/` for
  `./src/components/`, etc.)
