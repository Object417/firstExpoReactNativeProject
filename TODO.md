## Tasks

- [x] Screens navigation
- [x] Learn how to render other components with props
- [ ] Implement simple quiz logic
- [x] Look up for free APIs (Hiragana, Japanese words with pictures, audios)

  Couldn't find any. Only databases but they require a really long and deep research.
  So, I decided to retrieve information from websites by parsing on Python

- [ ] Add and configure `eslint`
- [ ] Find a way to use sort of Webpack resolve aliases (`Components/` for
      `./src/components/`, etc.)
- [ ] Find a way to automatically import `index`
      (e.g. `import Screen from "./screens"` ==> `import Screen from "./screens/index.jsx"`)
- [x] Set up Redux Store
- [x] Get all hiragana (dakuten and handakuten also) symbols
- [ ] Get a list of most popular common Japanese words
- [x] Replace handmade navigation on `QuizScreen` with `Stack.Navigator`
