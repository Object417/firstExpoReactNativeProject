# To Do

- [x] Screens navigation
- [x] Learn how to render other components with props
- [ ] Implement simple quiz logic
- [ ] Look up for free APIs (Hiragana, Japanese words with pictures, audios)

  Couldn't find any. Only databases but they require a really long and deep research.

- [ ] Add and configure `eslint`
- [ ] Find a way to use sort of Webpack resolve aliases (`Components/` for
      `./src/components/`, etc.)
- [x] Set up Redux Store
- [x] Get all hiragana (dakuten and handakuten also) symbols
- [ ] Get a list of most popular common Japanese words
